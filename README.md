# RFID Project - sk08
## General task discription:

The goal of this task is to read a bite message from RFID card using RC522 module.

## Progress:
- [x] I bought 2 RFID modules MFRC-522 13,56 MHz
- [x] Assemble and solder RC522

## Hardware Assembly
Here's a visual walkthrough of the RC522 module assembly process.

### Before Soldering
This is how the RC522 module looks before attaching the pin headers.
